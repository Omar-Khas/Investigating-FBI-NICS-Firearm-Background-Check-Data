## Introduction
In this investigation, we will be utilizing two datasets, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data and the U.S. Census Bureau data, to formulate answers to certain questions. Despite the fact that both datasets provide us with valuable information, we must acknowledge the presence of a margin of error in each of them, meaning that the conclusions we draw must be taken with a certain degree of caution. Furthermore, it is important to note that any uncertainty present in the data could lead to discrepancies between our findings and the actual reality of the situation. 

The NICS is integral to the procedure of purchasing a firearm or explosive, as required by federal legislation. It is a background check system that is utilized to verify that those who are trying to purchase such items are not forbidden from doing so under existing law. The NICS is an indispensable tool in preventing firearms and explosives from reaching the hands of individuals who are not legally permitted to possess them, such as those with a criminal record or mental health issues. Every time an individual attempts to purchase a firearm or explosive, the NICS provides a prompt and effective method to confirm that they are not barred from doing so.

The United States Census Bureau, a government agency primarily responsible for the collection of statistical data regarding the population, geography and economy of the country, is devoted to providing accurate and up-to-date information to the public. In addition to collecting the data with precision and care, the Bureau is also committed to protecting the private information of citizens and businesses, as mandated by federal law. The agency strives to guarantee that the data they present is complete and accurate, and is constantly revising its data to reflect any alterations that take place.

### The NICS Process
When someone attempts to buy a firearm, the seller, known as a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), contacts the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) electronically or by phone. The prospective buyer must fill out the Alcohol, Tobacco, & Firearms (ATF) [form](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/atf-form-4473-firearms-transaction-record-revisions). The FFL then relays that information to NICS. NICS staff performs a background check on the buyer to verify that they do not have a criminal record or are otherwise ineligible to purchase or own a firearm. Since its launch in 1998, NICS has conducted over 300 million checks, leading to more than 1.5 million denials.

### The Dataset
Each column represents a type of transaction submitted to the NICS. Additionally, each type of transaction is broken down by firearm type: handgun, long gun, and other. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [defines](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year_by_state_type.pdf/view) these firearms as follows:
- Handgun—(a) any firearm which has a short stock and is designed to be held and fired by the use of a single hand; and (b) any combination of parts from which a firearm described in paragraph (a) can be assembled.
- Long Gun—a weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade, and intended to be fired from the shoulder, and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the energy of the explosive in (a) a fixed metallic cartridge to fire a single projectile through a rifled bore for each single pull of the trigger; or (b) a fixed shotgun shell to fire through a smooth bore either
a number of ball shot or a single projectile for each single pull of the trigger.
- Other—refers to frames, receivers, and other firearms that are neither handguns nor long guns (rifles or shotguns), such as firearms having a pistol grip that expel a shotgun shell, or National Firearms Act firearms, including silencers.

The yellow-highlighted transaction types on the chart are for background checks initiated by a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) or criminal justice/law enforcement agency before issuing a firearm-related permit or transfer. "Multiple" indicates a background check with more than one type of firearm, and "admin" denotes administrative checks for other authorized uses of the NICS.

Other [types](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year_by_state_type.pdf/view) of transactions are explained below:
- Pre-Pawn—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees seeking to pledge or pawn a firearm as security for the payment or repayment of money, prior to actually pledging or pawning the firearm.
- Redemption—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees attempting to regain possession of a firearm after pledging or pawning a firearm as security at a pawn shop.
- Returned/Disposition—background checks requested by criminal justice/law enforcement agencies prior to returning a firearm in its possession to the respective transferee, to ensure the individual is not prohibited.
- Rentals—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees attempting to possess a firearm when the firearm is loaned or rented for use off the premises of the business.
- Private Sale—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees attempting to possess a firearm from a private party seller who is not an officially-licensed FFL.
- Return to Seller-Private Sale—background checks requested by an officially-licensed FFL on prospective firearm transferees attempting to possess a firearm from a private party seller who is not an officially-licensed FFL.

#### Important Note on the NCIS Data
**It is important to note that the statistics within this dataset represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.**

As noted in a 2015 article by [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/2015/11/black-friday-gun-sales-background-checks/),
>These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.

Yet, the article later states that _"Despite those vagaries, the FBI’s NICS numbers are widely accepted as the best proxy for total gun sales in a given time period."_

### The US Census Bureau Data
This investigation will make use of census data from the years 2011-2015 and 2010-2016 for each state. The census data comprises, but is not limited to, population, number of households, value of housing, and other factors.

In this investigation, the following censuses are [defined](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045222):
- **Population Estimates:** The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP) produces estimates of the population for the United States, its states, counties, cities, and towns, as well as for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its municipios (county-equivalents for Puerto Rico). Additionally, housing unit estimates are produced for the nation, states, and counties. The timing of the release of estimates varies according to the level of geography and demographic detail.
- **Female Persons:** The number of females is expressed as a percent of the total population.
- **White:** A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as "White" or report responses such as German, Irish, English, Italian, Lebanese, and Egyptian. The category also includes groups such as Polish, French, Iranian, Slavic, Cajun, Chaldean, etc.
- **Black or African American:** A person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as "Black or African American," or report responses such as African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian, Ethiopian, or Somali. The category also includes groups such as Ghanaian, South African, Barbadian, Kenyan, Liberian, Bahamian, etc.
- **American Indian and Alaska Native:** A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment. This category includes people who indicate their race as "American Indian or Alaska Native" or report entries such as Navajo Nation, Blackfeet Tribe, Mayan, Aztec, Native Village of Barrow Iñupiat Traditional Government, or Nome Eskimo Community.
- **Asian:** A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, India, China, the Philippine Islands, Japan, Korea, or Vietnam. It includes people who indicate their race as "Asian Indian," "Chinese," "Filipino," "Korean," Japanese," "Vietnamese," and "Other Asian" or provide other detailed Asian responses such as Pakistani, Cambodian, Hmong, Thai, Bengali, Mien, etc.
- **Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander:** A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. It includes people who indicate their race as "Native Hawaiian," "Chamorro," "Samoan," and "Other Pacific Islander" or provide other detailed Pacific Islander responses such as Palauan, Tahitian, Chuukese, Pohnpeian, Saipanese, Yapese, etc.
- **Two or more races:** People may choose to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes, by providing multiple responses, or by some combination of check boxes and other responses. The race response categories shown on the questionnaire are collapsed into the five minimum race groups identified by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Census Bureau's "Some Other Race" category. For data product purposes, "Two or More Races" refers to combinations of two or more of the following race categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Some Other Race.
- **Hispanic or Latino**: The terms "Hispanic," "Latino," and "Spanish" are used interchangeably. Some respondents identify with all three terms while others may identify with only one of these three specific terms. People who identify with the terms "Hispanic," "Latino," or "Spanish" are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish categories listed on the questionnaire ("Mexican, Mexican Am., or Chicano," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban") as well as those who indicate that they are "another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin." People who do not identify with one of the specific origins listed on the questionnaire but indicate that they are "another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin" are those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, or another Spanish culture or origin. Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.
- **Veterans:** Veteran status is used to identify people with active duty military service and service in the military Reserves and the National Guard. Veterans are men and women who have served (even for a short time), but are not currently serving, on active duty in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard, or who served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II. People who served in the National Guard or Reserves are classified as veterans only if they were ever called or ordered to active duty, not counting the initial training or yearly summer camps. All other civilians are classified as nonveterans. While it is possible for 17 year olds to be veterans of the Armed Forces, ACS data products are restricted to the population 18 years and older.
- **Housing Units:** A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall.
- **Median value of owner-occupied housing units:** Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. Owners of non-condominium multi-unit buildings who live in one of the building's units, like duplexes and small apartment buildings, should report the value of the building, the land, and any additional buildings on the same plot of land. For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. This tabulation includes only specified owner-occupied housing units--one-family houses on less than 10 acres without a business or medical office on the property. These data exclude mobile homes, houses with a business or medical office, houses on 10 or more acres, and housing units in multi-unit structures. Certain tabulations elsewhere include the value of all owner-occupied housing units and vacant-for-sale housing units. Also available are data on mortgage status and selected monthly owner costs. The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot) and one-half above the median. Median value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars.
- **Households:** A household includes all the the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living arrangements. Persons per household, or average household size, is obtained by dividing the number of people in households by the number of households.
- **High School Graduate or Higher:** High School Graduate or higher include people whose highest degree or level of school completed was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate, bachelor's, master's, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included. These data shown here include only persons 25 years old and over. The percentages are obtained by dividing the number of persons whose highest degree or level of school completed was high school graduate or higher by the total number of persons 25 years old and over.
- **Bachelor's Degree or Higher:** High Persons with a Bachelor's Degree or Higher are those who have received a bachelor's degree from a college or university, or a master's, professional, or doctorate degree. These data shown here include only persons 25 years old and over. The percentages are obtained by dividing the number of persons whose highest degree or level of school completed was bachelor's degree or higher  by the total number of persons 25 years old and over.
